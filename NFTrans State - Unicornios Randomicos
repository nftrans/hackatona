**Community -**
Paradox between community and market
Greater investment in technology, marketing, and DeFi
Lack of investment in human development
Need for a paradigm shift

When talking about Web 3, there's a significant focus on community and engagement. A paradox is observed between community-oriented thinking and a market focus on product indicators such as investments in marketing, DeFi, and development (technology). Investing in human development means understanding community and decentralized processes, highlighting the power of Web 3.0. There is a need for a paradigm shift, focusing on the individual.

**Creativity -**
Disconnection between creatives and developers
Importance of creativity in building new paradigms

The lack of investment in human development is reflected in the difficulty creatives face in participating in hackathons, connecting development and creativity. The importance of these processes for new community constructions within the ecosystem is emphasized.

**Inclusion -**
Inclusion is a demand of contemporaneity
Diversity is necessary for the health of communities
Handcrafted technologies and creative solutions outside hegemonic contexts

A paradigm shift is only possible through diversity, crucial for community health. Outside hegemonic contexts, excluded individuals find survival paths through community strategies. In their resistance, handcrafted technologies are discovered, analogous to Web 3.
